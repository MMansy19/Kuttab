# Authentication System Test Plan

This document outlines the testing approach for the authentication system to ensure it functions correctly and securely.

## Functional Testing

### User Registration

- [ ] User can register with valid information
- [ ] Form validation works for invalid inputs
- [ ] Password strength indicator displays correctly
- [ ] Role selection works properly
- [ ] Gender selection works properly
- [ ] After registration, user is redirected to login page
- [ ] Email is pre-filled on redirect to login page
- [ ] Error is shown for duplicate email addresses
- [ ] Social registration works properly

### Login

- [ ] User can login with valid credentials
- [ ] Error is shown for invalid credentials
- [ ] After login, user is redirected to appropriate dashboard
- [ ] "Remember me" functionality works as expected
- [ ] Social login works properly
- [ ] Session persistence works between page refreshes

### Logout

- [ ] User can logout successfully
- [ ] After logout, protected pages are no longer accessible
- [ ] Multiple tab synchronization works when logging out
- [ ] Session cookies are properly cleared

### Password Management

- [ ] Password strength is correctly evaluated
- [ ] Password reset request works
- [ ] Password can be changed with valid current password
- [ ] Error is shown when current password is incorrect

## Security Testing

### Authentication

- [ ] JWT tokens are properly signed and validated
- [ ] Session expiration works as expected
- [ ] Session revocation works when password is changed
- [ ] CSRF protection is in place
- [ ] Brute force protection is implemented (rate limiting)

### Authorization

- [ ] Protected routes properly redirect unauthenticated users
- [ ] Role-based access control works properly
- [ ] API routes are protected from unauthorized access
- [ ] Role-specific API endpoints check user permissions

### Data Protection

- [ ] Passwords are properly hashed
- [ ] Sensitive information is not exposed in API responses
- [ ] Session tokens have appropriate expiration times

## Integration Testing

### Components

- [ ] `AuthCard` properly renders its children
- [ ] `LoginForm` properly integrates with auth service
- [ ] `RegisterForm` properly integrates with auth service
- [ ] `PasswordStrengthIndicator` correctly evaluates passwords
- [ ] `UserMenu` displays the correct user information
- [ ] `RoleGuard` restricts access based on user role

### Hooks

- [ ] `useAuth` provides correct authentication state
- [ ] `useAuthRedirect` redirects users appropriately
- [ ] `useAuthSync` synchronizes auth state across browser tabs

### Providers

- [ ] `AuthProvider` provides auth context to components
- [ ] `AuthSyncProvider` properly handles cross-tab communication

## Cross-browser and Responsive Testing

- [ ] Authentication works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
- [ ] Login and registration forms are usable on mobile devices
- [ ] Session synchronization works across different browsers

## Performance Testing

- [ ] Authentication processes complete within acceptable time limits
- [ ] Session validation is optimized to prevent unnecessary API calls
- [ ] Components render efficiently without excessive re-renders

## Error Handling

- [ ] Network errors are properly handled
- [ ] API errors show appropriate user-friendly messages
- [ ] Server-side validation errors are displayed in the UI

## Accessibility Testing

- [ ] Forms can be navigated using keyboard only
- [ ] Form errors are properly announced to screen readers
- [ ] Color contrast ratios meet WCAG standards

## Test Cases

### Registration Test Cases

1. **Valid Registration**
   - Input: Valid name, email, password, role and gender
   - Expected: Success message, redirect to login page

2. **Duplicate Email**
   - Input: Email that already exists in the system
   - Expected: Error message about duplicate email

3. **Weak Password**
   - Input: Password less than 8 characters
   - Expected: Form validation error and strength indicator shows "Weak"

### Login Test Cases

1. **Valid Login**
   - Input: Valid email and password
   - Expected: Success, redirect to dashboard

2. **Invalid Password**
   - Input: Valid email with incorrect password
   - Expected: Error message about invalid credentials

3. **Non-existent User**
   - Input: Email that doesn't exist in the system
   - Expected: Error message about invalid credentials

### Role-Based Access Test Cases

1. **Admin Access**
   - Setup: Login as admin
   - Test: Access admin-only pages
   - Expected: Successful access

2. **Teacher Access**
   - Setup: Login as teacher
   - Test: Access teacher-only pages
   - Expected: Successful access

3. **Unauthorized Access**
   - Setup: Login as regular user
   - Test: Access admin-only pages
   - Expected: Redirect to user dashboard or access denied message

## Implementation Approach

1. Create manual test scripts for each test case
2. Implement automated tests using Jest and React Testing Library
3. Set up integration tests for critical auth flows
4. Perform security audit with focus on authentication and authorization
5. Conduct user testing for the registration and login processes
