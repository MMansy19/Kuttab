- **Geometric Pattern**: Incorporate subtle Islamic geometric patterns as background elements
- **Color Palette**: 
  - Primary: Deep teal/blue (#1D6A96) - representing wisdom and trust
  - Secondary: Gold/amber accent (#D4AF37) - representing excellence and heritage
  - Modern touch: Light mint/cyan (#7BCED1) - representing digital innovation
- **Typography**: Modern English bilingual logotype with "iKuttab"
- **Icon Element**: Include a minimal pen/quill or stylized "i" that transforms into a traditional reed pen

*Logo Prompt for AI Generation*: "Create a minimalist yet meaningful logo for 'iKuttab', an online Islamic education platform that connects students with traditional teachers. The logo should blend classic Islamic educational symbols (like an open book or reed pen) with a modern digital aesthetic. Include both Arabic (كُتّاب) and English (iKuttab) typography in a harmonious design with a color scheme of deep blue, gold accents, and light cyan highlights. The logo should work well in both dark and light backgrounds."
