# AI Prompt for iKuttab Logo

## Logo Generation Prompt

"Create a professional logo for 'iKuttab' (آي كُتّاب), an online Islamic education platform that connects students with traditional teachers. The logo should blend classic Islamic educational symbolism with modern digital aesthetics.

### Core Elements:
- Feature a stylized open book (representing the Quran) with subtle Islamic geometric patterns
- Include a minimalist pen/quill that transforms into or integrates with a stylized 'i' for 'iKuttab'
- Incorporate both Arabic (كُتّاب) and English (iKuttab) typography in a harmonious, balanced design
- The English 'iKuttab' should be modern and clean, while Arabic should maintain traditional elegance

### Color Scheme:
- Primary: Deep teal/blue (#1D6A96) - representing wisdom and trust
- Secondary: Gold/amber accent (#D4AF37) - representing excellence and heritage
- Tertiary: Light mint/cyan (#7BCED1) - representing digital innovation and freshness
- Background: Transparent, with optional white/dark versions

### Style Requirements:
- Minimalist and elegant design with clean lines
- Subtle integration of Islamic geometric patterns (not overwhelming)
- Professional and educational feel, appropriate for a learning platform
- Scalable design that remains recognizable as a small icon or large display
- Balance between traditional Islamic aesthetics and modern digital elements
- Should work well against both light and dark backgrounds

### Avoid:
- Complex, busy designs with too many elements
- Cliché Islamic imagery like mosque silhouettes
- Overly decorative Arabic calligraphy that reduces readability
- Childish or casual styling - maintain professional, educational tone

The final design should convey authority in Islamic education while feeling approachable and contemporary, reflecting the platform's mission of making traditional Islamic education accessible in the digital age."
